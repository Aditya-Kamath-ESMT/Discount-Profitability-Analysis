# Discount & Profitability Analysis – Retail Sales

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to understand how discounting strategies affect profitability. The analysis focuses on identifying loss-making patterns, evaluating product and customer performance, and uncovering operational drivers of profit and loss through descriptive analytics and data visualization.

## Project Context
This project is designed as a **business analytics exercise**, similar in structure to a **SQL-based analysis combined with dashboard-style data visualization**, but implemented in Python.  
The goal was to answer practical business questions using aggregations, grouping, and visual exploration—skills commonly used in SQL, BI tools, and analytics roles.

## Dataset
The dataset contains order-level retail transaction data, including:
- Sales, profit, quantity, and discount
- Product categories and sub-categories
- Customer segments and regions
- Order and shipping dates

The data spans multiple years and supports both profitability and operational analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales and profit distributions
- Evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability
- Identify loss-making orders and categories
- Compare performance across product sub-categories
- Assess customer segment and regional profitability
- Explore sales and profit trends over time

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights
- A significant share of orders are unprofitable despite positive sales
- Discounts above ~30% consistently result in losses
- Chairs and Furnishings are the most profitable sub-categories
- Tables are heavily loss-making
- Corporate customers generate the highest profit
- Profitability varies strongly by region and season

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how descriptive analytics and visualization can be used to uncover profitability drivers and operational inefficiencies. The analysis highlights the importance of disciplined discounting and margin-aware decision-making in retail operations.

## Future Improvements
- Recreate the analysis using SQL - ideally on a cloud based platform like AWS RDS as the next step forward in my analytical journey 
- Add contribution margin analysis
- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
- Further increase my supply chain knowledge via my course in ESMT scheduled on March 2026
